  <h1>Hello!</h1>
  
  <h2>I am Raisa Gandi Putri.</h2>

    <div class="about-me">
    <img src="./pic.jpg" alt="picture of myself" align="left" hspace="30" class="left">
    
    I was created and packaged in <a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.director.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Doing-business-in-indonesia.jpg?fit=1000%2C500&ssl=1" 
    target="_blank" style="color: #00e6b8">Jakarta, Indonesia</a>. Then, I was exported to California and re-packaged even further. I majored in Computer Science and minored in 
    Music at the <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu" target="_blank" style="color: #00e6b8">University of California, Davis</a>, and completed my education in a little over three years.</br> </br>  

    I was then shipped to Massachusetts, where I worked at Bose's Alexa Voice Cloud Team. There, I stretched my abilities as an engineer, and I was an apprentice to the most amazing and accomplished mentors who have now become my friends. I may be re-packaged or shipped to other destinations for the better, but one thing remains certain: I will always remain an apprentice. While I may evolve and move on to other destinations in this world, the relationships that I've built along the way are as permanent as I want them to be. </br><br>

    Along the journey in my quest for knowledge, I've left breadcrumbs through music. I started composing since I was thirteen years old - here's the first song I wrote and composed! I've been composing throughout high school and college as well. My primary instrument for music composition is the piano, but I occasionally sing, play violin, and guitar. I ventured from pop/singer-songwriter style in high school, to contemporary piano instrumentals in college, and finally I broke my artistic barriers while studying Electronic Music in my senior year of college where I composed avant-garde pieces like this. </br><br>
