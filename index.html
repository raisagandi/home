    Along the journey in my quest for knowledge, I've left breadcrumbs through music. I started composing since I was thirteen years old - here's the first song I wrote and composed!

I ventured from pop/singer-songwriter style in high school, to contemporary piano instrumentals in college, and finally I broke my artistic barriers while studying Electronic Music in my senior year of college where I composed avant-garde pieces like this. </br><br>
