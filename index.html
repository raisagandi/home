    <div class="about-me">

    Born and raised in  <a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.director.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Doing-business-in-indonesia.jpg?fit=1000%2C500&ssl=1" 
    target="_blank">Jakarta, Indonesia</a>, I am currently in my third year of college,
    majoring in Computer Science and minoring in 
    Music at the <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu" target="_blank">University of California, Davis</a>. </br> </br>
    
    
    My first experience building things dates back to middle school. 
    I started composing music when I was thirteen, and I have never stopped since then!
    I mainly compose piano pieces, and I write my own songs too! 
    I also love to sing - I sing my own songs and do covers as well.
    Please check out my originals and covers on my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/raisa-gandi-putri"
    target="_blank">SoundCloud</a>!</br></br>
    
    I started coding in my freshman year of college, and I enjoy it because it's fun, and 
    it's similar to making music! 
    The feeling of planning and perfecting separate parts, and then combining 
    them into a whole piece is thrilling. 
    I'll keep learning new frameworks and building things in the future,
    and hopefully I can create a positive impact through my code as well!
